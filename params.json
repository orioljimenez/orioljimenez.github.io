{"name":"Oriol Jim√©nez","tagline":"web developer & unix sysadmin","body":"### About me\r\nI'm passionate about computers since I was a child, working with open source UNIX systems since 94 and focused on Web Development since 98.\r\n\r\nSince 98 I was working for a wide range of companies from so many kinds. But all of them fit in two main categories: Software or Web Agencies and Internet Startups. Maybe the most remarkable, for their size and also because they are where I spent more time, are: Indra working for the ESA, Atrapalo and Grupo Intercom. In those companies I've played different roles around PHP development, from Backend Developer or System Administrator, through Software Architect, to CTO.\r\n\r\nActually I work at Resto-in as IT Development Manager and Software Architect which allows me, at least right now, to spend all my time doing one of my favorite things: develop with PHP :)\r\n\r\n### Some of my projects\r\n* [PHPBarcelona.org](http://phpbarcelona.org/) PHP Barcelona User Group\r\n* [PHPConference.es](http://phpconference.es/) PHP Barcelona Conference\r\n* [PHPBSD.net](http://www.phpbsd.net/) Blogging about PHP and BSD\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nEmail:\r\n```php\r\nmail('oriol'.chr(64).'phpbsd.net', $subject, $message);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSkype: _orioljimenez_\r\n\r\nSocial Networks:\r\n* http://twitter.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://facebook.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://linkedin.com/in/orioljimenez\r\n* http://github.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://pinterest.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://foursquare.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://instagram.com/orioljimenez\r\n* http://flickr.com/photos/orioljimenez\r\n","google":"UA-1907301-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
