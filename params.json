But all of them fit in two main categories: Software or Web Agencies and Internet Startups. Maybe the most remarkable, for their size and also because they are where I spent more time, are: Indra working for the ESA, Atrapalo and Grupo Intercom. In those companies I've played different roles around PHP development, from Backend Developer or System Administrator, through Software Architect, to CTO.\r\n\r\nActually I work at Resto-in as IT Development Manager and Software Architect which allows me, at least right now, to spend all my time doing one of my favorite things: develop with PHP :)\r\n\r\n### Some of my projects\r\nhttp://phpbarcelona.org PHP Barcelona User Group\r\nhttp://phpconference.es PHP Barcelona Conference\r\nhttp://phpbds.net Blogging about PHP and BSD\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nhttp://twitter.com/orioljimenez\r\nhttp://facebook.com/orioljimenez\r\nhttp://linkedin.com/in/orioljimenez\r\nhttp://github.com/orioljimenez\r\nhttps://pinterest.com/orioljimenez\r\n","google":"UA-1907301-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
